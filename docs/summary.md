# Project Summary

In this project, I created a Node.js/Express project skeleton and an initial server with the **GET /health** route.  
I configured **.env** and added a MySQL connection using **mysql2/promise**, creating the schema for the **users** table.  
I implemented basic functionality for creating users and retrieving a list of users from the database.  
I added input validation and implemented **POST /users** with proper error handling (including duplicate email cases).  
I implemented **GET /users** with email filtering and pagination, as well as a unified error response format.  
I wrote unit tests using **Jest** for the validation logic and minimal API tests using **Supertest**.  
I prepared the required deliverables: a Postman collection, database schema/seed, and a testing report.
