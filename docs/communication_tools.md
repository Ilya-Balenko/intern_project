# Daily Communication (Slack/Discord)

## Purpose
Slack/Discord (or a similar tool) is used for fast daily communication, coordination, and problem solving.

## Recommended channels
- **#general** — announcements and general updates
- **#dev** — development discussion, PR coordination, technical questions
- **#support** (optional) — bug reports and urgent issues

## Daily workflow
- Post short status updates:
  - what you worked on
  - what is planned next
  - blockers (if any)
- Share PR links when review is needed
- Ask questions early (avoid getting stuck for hours)

## Issue and incident handling
When reporting a problem, include:
- short description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- expected vs actual result
- logs / screenshots (if available)
- related PR/Issue link

## Etiquette
- Keep messages short and clear
- Use threads for discussions to avoid channel spam
- Use @mentions only when necessary
- Confirm decisions in writing (so the team has a clear record)
